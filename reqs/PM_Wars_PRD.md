# PM Wars

### TL;DR

PM Wars is a simple game that reimagines the Drug Wars economic loop for AI product management. Players have 60 in-game days to buy LLM tokens, craft AI SaaS products, sell them to enterprise and government clients, manage compounding debt, and avoid bankruptcy. The target audience is technically curious product managers, AI builders, and startup operators game fans who enjoy strategic resource optimization with a meme-forward AI industry theme.

## Functional Requirements

* Game Setup and Progression (Priority: P0)

  * New Game Initialization: Start each game with 60 days, $50,000 cash, $300,000 debt, 2% daily compounding interest, and no stored tokens or finished products.
  * End-Game Evaluation: At day 60 or quit, calculate final net worth as cash minus debt and assign a grade: Unicorn at $1M+, Series A at $500K+, Ramen Profitable at $100K+, Broke Even at $0+, and Bankrupt below $0.
  * Daily Time Tick: Advance the day counter, accrue debt interest, progress builds, apply decay, roll events, update clients, and rotate the roster in the correct sequence whenever time passes.
  * Bankruptcy Check: End the game only when cash is zero or below and no productive move is available.

* Provider and Token Economy (Priority: P0)

  * Provider Roster: Include Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Mistral with fixed quality ratings of 95%, 90%, 70%, 50%, and 62% respectively.
  * Token Types: Support Code, Reasoning, Image, Voice, and Video tokens, tracked in millions.
  * Dynamic Prices: Refresh provider prices on visit with roughly -30% to +40% variance from base prices and a $5 minimum floor.
  * Token Purchase: Allow players to buy tokens at the current provider, deduct cash, add inventory, and maintain average quality by token type.
  * Storage Limit: Enforce a total inventory cap of 500 million tokens.

* Product Crafting (Priority: P0)

  * Product Catalog: Support seven craftable products: AI Customer Support, Contract Analyzer, Brand Asset Generator, Compliance Dashboard, Training Video Platform, AI Security Scanner, and Marketing Copilot.
  * Recipes: Require the exact token mix, build days, and base values specified in the game specification.
  * Build Constraints: Allow only one active craft or refactor build at a time.
  * Quality Calculation: Set product quality as the weighted average of consumed token quality, with final build-day variance of plus or minus 5%.

## User Experience

Entry Point & First-Time User Experience

* The first screen introduces the premise: the player is a vibe-coding Senior PM trying to turn AI tokens into SaaS contracts before debt compounds into bankruptcy.
* The game explains the starting state: 60 days, $50,000 cash, $300,000 debt, and 2% daily debt interest.
* The player sees the current location, initial provider or client state, inventory, active client roster, and command shortcuts.
* No lengthy tutorial is required; the interface should teach through clear labels, action validation, and helpful error messages.

Core Experience

* Step 1: Assess current state.

  * The player reviews cash, debt, net worth, day count, location, token inventory, finished products, active build, and recent event messages.
  * The UI should make bankruptcy risk and storage usage highly visible.
  * The command bar should only show actions that are valid or explain why actions are unavailable.

* Step 2: Buy tokens from an LLM provider.

  * At a provider location, the player sees token prices by type and the provider's quality profile.
  * The player chooses token type and quantity.
  * The game validates cash, storage capacity, and quantity.
  * After purchase, the game updates cash, storage, and weighted average token quality.

* Step 3: Travel between providers and clients.

  * The player can move to another provider or client for $30,000 and 1 day.
  * On arrival at a provider, prices refresh.
  * The game applies the daily tick during travel, including interest, decay, events, and client updates.
  * If the player cannot afford travel, the game blocks the action unless another productive move exists.

* Step 4: Craft a SaaS product.

  * The player selects a product from the recipe catalog.
  * The game validates required token inventory and confirms build duration.
  * The game consumes recipe tokens immediately and starts the build.
  * The active build panel shows product name, days remaining, and current quality estimate.
  * Each passing day may damage the build through decay.

* Step 5: Complete and manage finished products.

  * On completion, the product receives final quality variance and moves to finished inventory.
  * Finished products can decay while sitting on the shelf.
  * The player can decide whether to sell quickly, wait for a better client, or refactor for higher quality.

* Step 6: Sell to a client.

  * At a client location, the player sees requested products, budgets, and minimum quality requirements.
  * The player selects an eligible finished product to sell.
  * The game validates that the client wants the product and that quality meets the minimum.
  * Revenue is calculated using the quality bonus formula and capped at 1.2x.
  * The sold product and fulfilled client want are removed.

* Step 7: Pay down debt or continue risk-taking.

  * The player can use cash to reduce debt and lower future compounding pressure.
  * The decision should feel strategic: paying debt improves survival, while holding cash funds token purchases and travel.

* Step 8: Reach the end state.

  * The game ends at day 60, by quit action, or by bankruptcy.
  * The final screen shows cash, debt, net worth, grade, and a tone-consistent summary message.

Advanced Features & Edge Cases

* If no random event fires but decay occurred, show decay as the headline so the player understands why quality changed.
* If a client drops a want that the player was targeting, the roster should update clearly and not silently invalidate strategy.
* If the player tries to refactor with low-quality Code tokens and projected lift is under 1%, refuse with a clear explanation.
* If cash reaches zero or below, the bankruptcy oracle must check every productive move before ending the game.
* If multiple products or clients match a sale condition, the UI should let the player choose rather than auto-select.
* If storage is full, token purchase should be blocked with a clear storage-cap message.

## Narrative

You are a vibe-coding Senior Product Manager with a dangerous amount of confidence, $50,000 in cash, and $300,000 of debt compounding at 2% per day. The market is moving fast: Anthropic is premium, Meta is cheap, Google is flooding the zone, and every enterprise client wants AI yesterday as long as it passes procurement. Your job is to arbitrage the chaos.

Each day, you decide where to spend scarce cash and time. You can buy cheap tokens and ship fast, but low-quality ingredients may fail government quality floors. You can overpay for premium tokens and chase big contracts, but debt compounds while builds decay and client priorities shift. A Compliance Dashboard might be worth a fortune after an EU AI Act shock, or it might sit on the shelf long enough to become yesterday's model wrapper.

PM Wars turns AI hype into a compact strategy loop: source tokens, craft products, refactor when quality is close, sell before demand rotates away, and decide whether to pay down debt or take one more risky swing. At the end of 60 days, the market renders judgment. Maybe you become a Unicorn. Maybe you scrape into Ramen Profitable. Or maybe the vibes were not coding.
